# silvering sun rl

"The Silvering Sun" is a roguelike following this tutorial: https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/roguesharp-v3-tutorial-introduction-and-goals/

Ok so I finished these tutorials and the rl works as described. That's neato. 

Now exploring SadConsole + Roguesharp as it looks like RLNET hasn't been updated in a while. Future commits will be based on SadConsoel rather than RLNET.
