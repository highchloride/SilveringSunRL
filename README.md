# Silvering Sun RL

"The Silvering Sun" is a roguelike I cobbled together from a couple of tutorials. 

It leverages RogueSharp and SadConsole.

At the moment, it's a bit of a mess. I'm merging the results of a few different tutorials into one cohesive, random-map-generating, SadConsole-powered RL. It doesn't display anything at the moment. 

### How to play

Build from the solution file, or run bin/Debug/silveringsunrl.exe.

### Controls

Arrow keys for up down left and right

Run into enemies to attack them

Left carat is stairs up, Right carat is stairs down. Stand on a Stairs down and press Period to advance to the next level.

Press escape to close.

### "Why 'Silvering Sun?'"
Old story idea regarding a fading world and a piece of prophetic verse describing "the muted sky and the silvering sun."
