# Silvering Sun RL

"The Silvering Sun" is a roguelike following this tutorial: https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/2016/02/20/roguesharp-v3-tutorial-introduction-and-goals/

Ok so I finished these tutorials and the rl works as described. That's neato. 

Now exploring SadConsole + Roguesharp as it looks like RLNET hasn't been updated in a while. Future commits will be based on SadConsoel rather than RLNET.

### How to play

Build from the solution file, or run bin/Debug/silveringsunrl.exe.

### Controls

Arrow keys for up down left and right

Run into enemies to attack them

Left carat is stairs up, Right carat is stairs down. Stand on a Stairs down and press Period to advance to the next level.

Press escape to close.

### "Why 'Silvering Sun?'"
Old story idea regarding a fading world and a piece of prophetic verse describing "the muted sky and the silvering sun."
